Hi, my name is Andrea. I am a PhD student in Evolutionary Biology and Ecology at the [University of Rome "Tor Vergata"](https://web.uniroma2.it/) in the `Integrative Physiology and Metabolism Laboratory` where I work on studying adipose tissue response to environmental stimuli using high-dimensional transcriptomics approaches like single-cell RNA-seq.
